# awesome-robots
This repository collects all the awesome bots on GitHub 🤖️

## Robots
* [ti-chi-bot](https://github.com/ti-chi-bot) - I run tests, add labels and merge code for you. Please bother @hi-rustin if I appear to be misbehaving. I try to be a good bot, but sometimes I fall short.
* [k8s-ci-robot](https://github.com/k8s-ci-robot) - I run your tests, add your labels, and merge your code.
* [k8s-github-robot](https://github.com/k8s-github-robot) - I am @k8s-ci-robot's evil twin. I manage GitHub configuration for @kubernetes.
* [bors](https://github.com/apps/bors) - Bors-NG (the Next-Generation implementation of “bors”) is a GitHub App that automates a “common sense” workflow for software development on GitHub: merge a pull request and master together, run the test suite, then push the merged whole up into the master branch. This means that whatever is in master branch has passed the tests, no matter what, even if there are subtle interactions between different pull requests.
* [bors(rust)](https://github.com/bors)
* [rust-highfive](https://github.com/rust-highfive) - Managed by the Rust Infra Team. Find us on #infra on discord.gg/rust-lang

* [typescript-bot](https://github.com/typescript-bot) - bleep bloop, I am a robot. Please bother @RyanCavanaugh if I appear to be misbehaving. I try to be a good bot, but sometimes I fall short.
